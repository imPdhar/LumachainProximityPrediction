# Proximity/Distance prediction

This was the AI code that was designed for detecting men and women proximity.


## Features 

- Detects number of close proximity violations
- Used Transfer Learning
- States number of violations in an instance in real time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
## Requirements:

- OpenCV- `pip install opencv-python` 		
- imutils- `pip install imutils`
- An appropriate dataset like [coco](https://cocodataset.org/#download). 

## How to use

-  Install the requirements.
   1. Place the video file in the root directory.
   2. Use bash/shell to run the code with the --input file.mp4 parameters.

## Known Errors

Incorrect detection of Male/Females. 

**Solution**: Needs more training. Use LabelImg or any darknet executable.
